# Welcome to Article-App

[Article-App](https://aritcle-app-x.herokuapp.com/)

This is a simple app that allows you to create articles and share them with other users.

## Getting Started

To get started with the app, clone the repo and then create a new python virtual environment.

```
git clone <repo-url> 
cd article-app
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Next, install the needed packages (while the virtual environment is activated):

```
(.venv)$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Finally, run the development server:

```
(.venv)$ python app.py runserver
```

The app will be available at [localhost](http://localhost:5001/).
